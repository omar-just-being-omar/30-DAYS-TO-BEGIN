      <h1>Build a Website About Yourself</h1>

      <div class="chunk">
        <p class="chunk-text">Building a personal website about yourself isn’t necessarily the best career move, and that’s kind of the point. This isn’t about resumes or impressing recruiters. It’s about creating a space that reflects who you are and what you’re proud of. You get to practice programming without pressure, experiment freely, and actually enjoy the process.</p>
        <p class="chunk-text">You can add pages about what you love in life, what you’re grateful for, your future wishes, or who you want to become. It can hold everything that makes you you. And the best part? You’re allowed to make as many mistakes as you want. It’s a wholesome project that helps you learn by building something personal, and that makes the learning stick.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">What problem does this address?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">The goal isn’t an impressive project for your resumé. 
<br>Most people don’t have a space to try things just for themselves. This project gives you a playground to experiment, learn, and express who you are—without pressure or judgment. Most people never have that. They’re stuck copying tutorials or scrolling endlessly online. This fixes that: it gives you a project that’s meaningful, personal, and pressure-free.
</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">Why do it? What will you gain?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">Because you learn better when it matters to <i>you</i>. When the project is about your interests and your ambitions, you’ll actually stick with it.<br> You also flex a ton of soft and hard skills: programming, design, storytelling, and self-reflection. And it feels amazing to see your ideas take shape.<br> Plus, it’s way more fun than doing random exercises in a course.</p>

<p class="chunk-text">
You’ll gain skills, confidence, and clarity. <br>On the skills side: coding, UX/UI, writing, structuring ideas. On the confidence side: you’ll see mistakes, fix them, and grow—without anyone judging you. <br>And you will figure out what actually matters to you, what you love, and where you’re headed. 
</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">How to do it?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">Start with one page. Just a simple HTML page. Add a section about basic info about yourself, then your favorite books, sports, whatever. Then slowly add pages: one about your hobbies, one about your future goals, maybe one about lessons you’ve learned, one about the people you love, one about what you’re grateful for. <br>Write as many pages as you want about yourself. Don’t overthink the code—you’re learning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">How to stay consistent?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">Set a simple daily Goal, even 30 minutes a day counts. And don’t chase perfection—mistakes are the point of this project. <br>
One of the biggest mistakes I personally made is that when there’s an error, I would stay for days and sometimes even weeks just to solve this error. Please don’t make the same mistake, skip the error for now, mark it so you don’t forget, and move on with your website.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">Why are 30 days enough to start it?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">30 days isn’t about making a perfect website—it’s about forming the habit and finishing a first version. You will get used to coding + learned some basic web development. And it gives you momentum for bigger projects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">What does success look like after 30 days?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">Honestly, it depends. Personally, I think you can learn the basic HTML and CSS skills to make a basic page in just 10 days, or even make the whole website with those two only.<br> <em>BUT</em>, if you wanna make it a little better, not just dull, maybe you can mix in some JS or design it as you want. In that case, it would probably take you some time to even start (of course depends on how much you study every day). However, if you have just the basics to start immediately, I think you can finish a decent part of this website. <br>Everything depends on you in this project, so I can’t guess what it will look like after 30 days.

</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">What usually goes wrong</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">Perfectionism is the killer. People get stuck tweaking colors, fonts, or coding endlessly. Another trap is inconsistency—life happens, but skipping too often kills momentum. And sometimes, you copy tutorials without understanding them, which makes the project worthless and lifeless. And again, Please don't get caught up on every error, just mark it so you don’t forget, and move on with your website.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">What system or free resources help?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text"><ol>
           <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/courses" target="_blank">Kevin Powell (YouTube courses)</a><br>This YouTube channel is amazing! You can start with the “HTML & CSS for absolute beginners” course. You will find anything you want about CSS in this channel.</li> <br>
           <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a><br>Literally the most popular course platform for web development. You will find probably anything you want about learning web development.</li> <br>
           <li><a href="https://codepip.com/?" target="_blank">Codepip (games)</a><br> it's a website that teaches programming with fun games! It's a great way to practice coding concepts in a playful environment (HTML, JS, CSS).<br> But personally, I don't think you can LEARN EVERYTHING from it, but it's a great way to practice.</li> <br>
              <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a><br> And finally, this is where you'll write your code! it's the most popular code editor for web development, and it has a decent set of features for beginners.</li>
            <br> And of course, the free courses are literally endless on YouTube about web development, just search for what you want to build! And if you don't know already, you can use GitHub to publish your website for free.
        </ol></p>
      </div>

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2 class="chunk-title">What transferable lesson does this teach?</h2>
        <p class="chunk-text">Patience, self-discipline, and iteration. You’ll learn how to take a vague idea, break it into steps, and see it through. That’s literally what success in life, school, and work comes down to—building, failing, learning, iterating. <br>You’ll also internalize that mistakes aren’t failures—they’re your stepping stones.</p>
